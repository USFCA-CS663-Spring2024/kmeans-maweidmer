# KMeans

Assignment 2 - CS 663 - Machine Learning

In addition to this README.md file, this repository contains two (2) files:
* `Assignment 2 - Clustering.ipynb`: which is a notebook for you to start your implementation of this assignment
* `cluster.py`: which can be the superclass for your implementation of KMeans

You may make any changes you like to the notebook. Find assignment details as well as links to the required data on Canvas.
